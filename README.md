This simple 'Graphics Engine' demonstrates how one would store information about the physical game-world as 3-dimensional coordinates, lines, trapeziums, trapezoids etc... and then project them via some given mapping (in this case, the simple coordinate mapping) onto the 2-d plane. To run, 

`cd src`
`java MainClass`
